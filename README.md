### Project Description
Dr.Bubbles is a lighthearted web app that creates a playful “health report” for a fish.
Upload any image, fill in details, and get a fun, themed PDF certificate.
Perfect for jokes, gifts, or just making someone smile.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People around the world are suffering from a tragic lack of official fish health paperwork.
How can anyone trust that your goldfish is in peak condition without a certified, signed document from Dr. Bubbles?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With the power of pixels, PDFs, and pure silliness, our app lets you upload a fish photo, add some “medical” notes, and instantly receive an official Fish Health Fun Certificate—signed by the illustrious Dr. Bubbles.
It’s unnecessary, over-the-top, and exactly what the world didn’t know it needed.
